00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:18,000
>> Hi again！>> Hi again!

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,533
>> Hi Sebastian! Astro!

4
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:27,367
It's my unbelievable pleasure and a privilege to

5
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:29,600
present my best friend, longtime friend --

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,900
Astro Teller -- grand sum of infinitely

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,066
noble Lords of similar names: head of

8
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:43,233
Google X, now X labs, and general genius

9
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:46,233
and wonderful human being to you. Some of

10
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:49,433
you might know him, but welcome. >> Thank you

11
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:56,767
very much. My very first question I can't

12
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:58,734
help is, what's this with this jacket?

13
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:01,867
>> This is just what I put on this morning.

14
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:05,233
But in fact I got this jacket, I think

15
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,600
someone was trying to prank me. They gave

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,700
me this jacket and I mean, in Craig

17
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,066
Barrett who at the time also worked at

18
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:14,867
Alphabet. A matching jacket it wasn't an

19
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,166
r2d2 jacket, it was a wiki jacket so it

20
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,834
had like the bandolier across here, and

21
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:21,433
like the pull up the hood and was all

22
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:23,667
fuzzy, and he just said no way, I'm not

23
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,333
wearing that. Because we were going to

24
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,300
spend a day. I'm seeing an event kind of

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,333
like this together, that he didn't wear

26
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,433
it and I just thought, you know, it's a

27
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,834
little bit lame, I'm gonna wear my r2d2

28
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:35,934
jacket, so even though, I mean I'm into

29
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:37,333
Star Wars, but I'm not super into Star

30
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,834
Wars, but if I work for the day just for

31
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,367
fun, I don't know, and then I got into it.

32
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,066
I'm just enjoying being a robot, I guess.

33
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:46,033
I guess you are robots? >> Just

34
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:48,433
kidding. >> But you just joined us as a

35
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:50,000
hiring partner. >> Yes we did!

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,333
>> That is great too.

37
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:59,900
I think shortly after I got fired, I

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,467
think this became the best place to work

39
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:04,533
in Silicon Vally. >> No, that's a total

40
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:10,200
coincidence. >> What are you hiring?

41
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,633
>> Well, we are hiring lots of things. We're

42
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,467
certainly hiring roboticists, we care a

43
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,066
lot about machine learning, a lot of the

44
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:19,800
work that we do at X is systems

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,166
integration work. We don't do a lot of

46
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,133
basic science essentially, but we work on

47
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:27,001
problems that haven't been solved before.

48
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:29,100
And so a lot of that turns out to be

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,400
complex iterative system integration

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,166
kind of work, taking pieces that already

51
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,533
exists in the world, sometimes that

52
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,033
custom versions of them have to be made,

53
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:41,934
and putting together in unusual ways,

54
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:44,133
getting it out in the world, trying,

55
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,667
you've discovered that you're wrong, and

56
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,100
you make a new design, you repeat, is the

57
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,767
sort of general way that it feels I

58
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:53,166
think for all of the X projects. So

59
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,600
people who are good at that.

60
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,033
>> I want to take you 50 years in

61
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:59,834
the future, tell me what's gonna be.

62
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:02,533
>> Awesome, let's go. >> I don't obey this law

63
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,333
what's gonna be interesting in 50 years?

64
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:08,367
>> I think the world is going to be

65
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:11,500
almost unrecognizable in 20. So... >> it's gonna be bad ?

66
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,266
>> I'm sure it'll be a mix, I think

67
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:16,967
mainly it'll be a pretty exciting and

68
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:18,800
mostly positive place. I'm sure it's

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,367
going to be disorienting getting there.

70
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,100
>> They talk about a nuclear winter.

71
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,900
>> I don't know, I think that the world is

72
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,734
going to turn out to surprise us more

73
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:28,734
positively than negatively. But the world

74
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:31,000
is going to be incredibly different 20

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,900
years. The saying is, and I think that

76
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,166
this is correct, that people tend to

77
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,734
overestimate the progress of Technology

78
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:41,533
and the rate of change in the short term,

79
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:44,166
that is three years from now, they think

80
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,567
the world would be more different than

81
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:48,400
it is. And they underestimate it in the

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,533
medium term, over 10 to 20 years, I think

83
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,600
we all collectively can't really imagine

84
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,734
how different it will be. My rule of

85
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,900
thumb would be, 20 years from now ought

86
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,967
to be roughly like a hundred years in

87
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,133
the past. So if you can imagine the last

88
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,767
hundred years of change and next twenty,

89
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:07,233
I think that that's probably a realistic estimate

90
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:08,900
for how different the world will feel.

91
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,934
>> Wow that means people have to learn

92
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,800
a lot along the way. >> Yes. I think our

93
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,533
society is not yet wired for the rate of

94
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,166
change that we're going to be

95
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,266
experiencing. >> One thing it always

96
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:22,333
impresses me on yours is your attitude

97
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,834
towards innovation and specifically

98
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,867
things like fear and failure and so on.

99
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,967
You celebrate when you fire people over

100
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:34,300
for its fears, is that correct? >> Yeah I

101
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,200
mean, I'm not sure we would celebrate

102
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,633
letting someone go. Though, sometimes it

103
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:41,900
is the case that we helped people to go

104
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,533
to a place that is better for them, and I

105
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:47,433
have, at least on occasion had them...

106
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:50,367
>> Liberate them. >> Yes absolutely. It is

107
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:54,033
sometimes the case, that, you know, Susie

108
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:56,367
can be great somewhere, but the place she

109
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:58,700
currently is is not where she can be

110
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,433
great, and it is a favor to Susie's team

111
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:06,166
and to myself, but also to Susie, to tell

112
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,567
that to Susie. Certainly not telling her

113
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:10,133
that and letting her just suffer

114
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:12,600
indefinitely being not excellent when

115
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,033
she has the capacity to be excellent,

116
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,934
it's not doing anybody, particularly

117
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,867
Susie, a favor. >> You do that, by the way,

118
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:20,467
all our students.. >> Liberating all

119
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,567
of them ? >> You can graduate them. >> Yes,

120
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,333
well, I do the same thing with our projects.

121
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,367
>> Yes, Stanford doesn't remember.. we

122
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,233
have these wonderful pompous moment

123
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:32,367
when we kick out every student. >> I think

124
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,000
the parents come just elevator with him

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,433
about this. >> That's why we call a

126
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:40,934
graduation for the project and X so

127
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:42,133
instead of feeling like they're being

128
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,367
kicked out of Eden, they feel a little

129
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:45,633
bit more like they're leaving home and

130
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:48,934
going to college hopefully. >> Steve

131
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:51,166
Blankie before a NASA wanna ask a

132
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,000
question, and I want to ask you the same

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,400
question. I want you to go back to

134
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,100
your 18 years old self, when you

135
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,934
just enter in college, what advice would

136
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:06,433
you give yourself. >> You know, one of the

137
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,467
things that I think about frequently if

138
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,800
I could go back and change something, it

139
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,934
was a little moment, but it's become

140
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:15,667
actually bigger for me over time instead

141
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:20,000
of smaller. I was a junior, so maybe nine

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,700
twenty-something, 20 years old

143
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,967
probably at Stanford. My brother had

144
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,367
just got into Stanford, he was a freshman,

145
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:28,834
he was doing an undergraduate degree in

146
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,400
physics but he was spending actually

147
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,433
more of his time doing acting, being a

148
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:36,100
thespian than being doing his physics

149
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,333
degree. I was getting to know his

150
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,300
mentor whose name's Winter Meade.

151
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,100
After one of the shows, Winter came up

152
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,200
to me and he said, you'd be great in the

153
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
theater, you should really join the

154
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,033
company and do something. And I said, oh

155
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:53,233
no, I'm really busy, I had some set of

156
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:56,000
excuses, and I was really busy. That's not

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,533
why I said no. I was afraid. I just I

158
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,266
don't know, I think was probably because

159
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:04,734
it wasn’t important to me. And I've

160
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:07,333
regretted that ever since. Not because I

161
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,834
want to be in the theater, it just

162
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:10,967
bothers me. It's one of the few things in

163
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,500
my life I didn't do, because I was afraid.

164
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,800
And I know I didn't do it because I was

165
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,033
afraid. And I thought ever since, I'm not

166
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:20,333
doing that. I can fail for all kinds of

167
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,000
reasons, but I'm not going to fail again

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,567
cuz I was just too afraid to try. >> So now

169
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:26,633
when you’re afraid, you do it? >> Yeah I am

170
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:28,266
actually counter phobic… >> How can you

171
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:31,967
drive a car. >> I'm not afraid to track a

172
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:33,967
car I really, actually, but I'm not yet to

173
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:39,533
run a red light. >> Different story. You've

174
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:41,700
done an unbelievably amazing job as the

175
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,333
key of Silicon Valley, the magician who

176
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,200
puts balloon into the stratosphere. Does

177
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,900
self-driving cars and whatever it is

178
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,367
that you've been doing in X. What is your

179
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:56,700
vessel tank, and maybe I take a

180
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,333
tiny bit of credit as well, but what's

181
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:02,533
your recipe, not so true, to this

182
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:05,100
organization evolves and matures and

183
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,033
quite frankly gets larger in size ,to

184
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:09,934
keep it fresh. How do you keep the

185
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:14,600
innovative genes going. >> I think a lot

186
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,066
about all the tensions that we have at X,

187
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,600
and some of the tensions are fairly

188
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,033
straightforward, some of them less

189
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:26,667
straightforward. But for example, we have

190
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:30,200
to have raging optimism or we would

191
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,934
never try the things that we try. But if

192
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:33,633
you just

193
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:36,133
power people have raging optimism, go

194
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:38,500
forth, be crazy, the crazier the better.

195
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,567
Without limits, you are not going to get

196
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:43,233
good results. So there has to be a kind

197
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,800
of scathing paranoia and skepticism that

198
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,333
balances out that optimism. You have to

199
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,633
keep those in balance if you're actually

200
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:54,400
going to get what you want. But that's

201
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,066
not the only kind of tension that we

202
00:08:56,066 --> 00:09:00,100
have. Another one is the.. you know, what

203
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,533
you could say, positively would be to

204
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:03,934
support structures at X, or if you want

205
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,700
to be negative about it, the bureaucracy

206
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,567
at X. So we want to bring to bear on

207
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,400
projects the right help at the right

208
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,467
time, to amplify them or to help, you know,

209
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,767
move them on to a better path when

210
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,333
they're sort of veering off of the path.

211
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,400
In the best-case scenarios, that's

212
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,834
wonderful, of course, it sounds really

213
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:24,533
positive the way I just said that. But if

214
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,033
it's done wrong, it sure feels like

215
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,233
bureaucracy to the project leads. And

216
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,300
they sometimes express that to me, and

217
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,233
the bureaucracy is the last thing that I

218
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,467
want to produce. So that's another

219
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:37,166
example where having no structure

220
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,567
doesn't make any sense. Then we're just a

221
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:39,633
venture capitalist, we're just giving

222
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,300
people money and walking away. That

223
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,266
doesn't makes sense for us to do that.

224
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:45,934
But if we smother them with the tention, if

225
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,667
I think that I know how to do their job

226
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,734
better than them, one of us is redundant,

227
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:51,867
like that's a bad plan, so getting that

228
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:55,633
light touch is another example where

229
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,900
both ends of the spectrum are bad, and

230
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,033
there's somewhere in the middle that's

231
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,633
right and we're always sort of searching

232
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:05,100
for it. >>A lot of students and

233
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,533
partners came from, I think over 20

234
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,934
countries, which is amazing, including places

235
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:15,033
as always Jordan, Estonia. What is the

236
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:17,300
magic of Silicon Valley, and what can you

237
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,567
take home for different countries.

238
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:22,066
>> There's something in the water here

239
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:24,633
that's certainly palpable I think for

240
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:27,066
the people. >> I'm not

241
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,400
actually suggesting taking the water

242
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,066
home. You know what,

243
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:33,934
one of the ways, that is not my favorite

244
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,001
phraseology, but I've heard it frequently

245
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:39,900
is a culture of creative destruction. And

246
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,100
so that's not what I would take home, but

247
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,767
I think that that's what you might hear

248
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,233
frequently. One of the ways I might

249
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:49,834
prefer it, would be a healthy embrace of

250
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:53,233
failure. So someone was just asking me as

251
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:56,433
a Korean newspaper as asking me how can

252
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:59,233
the companies in Korea do better, they

253
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:03,767
feel really afraid to take risks because

254
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:07,400
they might look bad. And I don't know

255
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,001
this is true, but this was a suggestion I

256
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,767
gave yesterday morning, to this reporter

257
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:14,934
to take back to companies in Korea, which

258
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:18,834
was, it's not that we want to look bad in

259
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,166
Silicon Valley. I don't think that's it

260
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,900
at all. But I'm willing to look

261
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,166
arbitrarily stupid right now, if that's

262
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,400
what it takes to win in the long run. I

263
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,867
think it's a time horizon difference. If

264
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:35,900
you understand and can connect that

265
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,934
being open to being wrong now is the

266
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:42,033
essence of learning, and that learning is

267
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,133
the superpower that causes you to win,

268
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:48,233
then you become hungry to be wrong and

269
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:51,166
to start over, and to try new things now,

270
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,266
no matter how imperfect it makes you

271
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:55,633
look in the short term, because your time

272
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:58,734
horizon on which you're unwilling to

273
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:01,867
lose, is very long. And so I think, even

274
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:03,934
though there is a culture of speed in

275
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:06,600
Silicon Valley, I believe that the length

276
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,033
of the time horizon over which people

277
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:11,400
are trying to optimize themselves being

278
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,066
longer, may actually be part of the

279
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,233
secret sauce. >> We have microphones and I

280
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,800
want to open up for audience question in

281
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,967
a minute. So if you want to line up

282
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,500
between these two microphones piece as

283
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,066
usual. But I have one question, by

284
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:29,867
dividing up tell us about his son.

285
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:31,600
>> So he's referring to the fact that my

286
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,667
son finished his first nanodegree a

287
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,567
little over a year ago, his name is

288
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:39,233
Griffin teller, and he did the

289
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,800
introduction of computer science, he

290
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,400
really enjoyed it, he was

291
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,433
just during 12 when he finished it, and

292
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:50,233
he's struggling his way here working

293
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,467
hard and our little struggling might not

294
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:53,533
be fair, even through the machine

295
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,533
learning course. And I just...

296
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:58,333
I told Sebastian this over

297
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,266
dinner last week, and he said, oh that's

298
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:01,934
actually one of the really hard courses.

299
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:03,500
And I went home and said, you know,

300
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,533
Griffin, you're going pretty slowly

301
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,500
through it. Sebastian says that's one of

302
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,934
the really hard ones, you want to ask for

303
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:10,266
help? Do you want to switch to one that's

304
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,433
easier? He's like, no, no, I got it. I

305
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:14,300
just... I have to like go back and like

306
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,734
learn a whole bunch of extra math, every

307
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:20,300
time I get to the next phase. He's 13 now, so..

308
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,400
But I'm very very grateful to Udacity,

309
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,600
because Griffin's a brave boy, and he's

310
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,600
hard-working, and he's focused, but that

311
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,567
by itself I was just saying back in the

312
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,367
green room, wouldn't actually have

313
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:35,333
translated to something like this. I

314
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,633
don't think it's an accident that he's

315
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,333
not doing chemistry or physics or

316
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,734
history, there isn't a platform for

317
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:43,333
supporting him doing that. And Udacity

318
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,033
has actually provided him with just the

319
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,567
right kind of structure, so he has to

320
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:50,367
work hard, he can self paces learning, it

321
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:51,734
means a huge amount to him. It's

322
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:53,100
actually part of why I'm here today. >> Yeah

323
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,200
we have over 20 recruiter both sides, and

324
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,900
I think you should bring him here and

325
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,767
talk to them. >> Excellent. otherwise over

326
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:03,066
tuition tax. Let's start in the center.

327
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:09,166
>> Hello Dr. Teller, could you perhaps share

328
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,533
a little bit about the use of

329
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:14,667
reinforcement learning in hedge fund, perhaps?

330
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:17,166
>> Reinforcement learning in which domain?

331
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,700
>> In hedge funds or financial. >> Hedge funds.

332
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,166
I'm not sure reinforcement learning is...

333
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:28,433
The only issue, let me answer your question more

334
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:33,767
generally. The time I believe where the

335
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:36,367
application of machine learning in many

336
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:39,934
domains, to the individual problems as

337
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:44,333
posed by humans is ending. It'll go away

338
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,066
over, you know, 10 or 20 years. It won't

339
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:48,367
happen overnight. The thing which is

340
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,467
starting to be the case and one of the

341
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:51,734
areas in which you can see this

342
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,633
happening is hedge funds, is where the

343
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:56,800
questions themselves are being asked by

344
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,567
machine learning.

345
00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:00,533
Now it often won't look like, and machine

346
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,033
learning being, you know, deep nets and

347
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,300
reinforcement learning and a number of

348
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,967
other tools. It sometimes won't look

349
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:07,633
like the question is being asked, but

350
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:11,000
when you do end-to-end learning of any

351
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,934
kind in any domain, you are essentially

352
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:16,200
leaving up to the system that's doing

353
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,033
the learning, more of the decomposition

354
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:22,700
of the problem to the computer, to the

355
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,333
learning system, that's part of the

356
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,834
task -- the featurizing of the data, the

357
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,834
decomposition of the problem, that's what

358
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:31,900
humans used to do. And so I think that

359
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,033
movement is something we're going to see

360
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,300
a lot, more of at computers essentially

361
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,467
starting to ask the questions and

362
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:42,133
structure the problem as well as

363
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:44,367
actually solving the problem. And hedge

364
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:45,767
funds is definitely one of the areas in

365
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:48,400
which that's happening. >> All right, thank

366
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,400
you so much. >> Would you summarize your

367
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,967
view of failure, on failure as fail fast,

368
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:59,200
learn faster? >> Yes, I mean fail fast is

369
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,667
lip service, which is thrown around very

370
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,934
liberally all around the valley and

371
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:06,900
other places. And I think it largely does

372
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,967
not get people what they want. And so

373
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,533
there's nothing wrong with the term

374
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:14,166
fail fast, but that and the dollar fifty

375
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,633
will get you on the bus. The problem is

376
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:20,233
that, there's the lip service of whatever

377
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:22,700
you say, like fail fast, and then there's

378
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
the actual way that people behave. And

379
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,767
the reason that those pointers are so

380
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,600
different, is because these are the

381
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,367
emotional paths of least resistance in

382
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:34,200
your organization. And you can say fail

383
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,867
fast until the cows come home, but if you

384
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:38,867
punish people, in fact if you do anything

385
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:41,066
short of actively rewarding them when

386
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,166
they fail, it doesn't matter that you say

387
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,834
fail fast. So what do you mean it when

388
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:48,533
you say fail fast. And so we have

389
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:51,600
mechanisms at X to reward people when

390
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,467
they stand up and they say, that was a

391
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,767
worthwhile experiment we just ran, and

392
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:58,033
the results of the experiment is the

393
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:00,033
null hypothesis, i.e. we shouldn't keep

394
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:02,100
doing that. Great, let's go on to the next

395
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,333
one. You reward them in that moment, you

396
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,633
don't punish them for admitting that the

397
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,233
result of the experiment was the null

398
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:10,800
hypothesis. That's often the answer when you

399
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,900
run an experiment. But that's not how

400
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,734
most corporations work, that's not how

401
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,567
people feel when they go to work in the

402
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,233
morning. They want to get an atta boy

403
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:20,734
from their peers, they want to get an

404
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:22,467
atta boy from their manager, if they

405
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:24,633
can't get one by saying my thing didn't

406
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:27,000
work, they will not say my thing did not work.

407
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,000
>> Hey Dr. Teller, so related to the talk,

408
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,100
so add a question, so does moonshots work

409
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,400
on problems like starvation and hunger, I

410
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,333
mean can we ever solve real problems

411
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,800
today with technology. Like starvation

412
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,867
hunger as an example. >> Sure, I don't have a

413
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:52,567
ready solution for starvation and hunger,

414
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,867
but I don't think that any problem is

415
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,367
immune to moonshot thinking. So at least

416
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,867
the way we would define it in X, a

417
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:01,066
moonshot has three basic components:

418
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:03,200
there has to be a huge problem with the

419
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,166
world that you can name and you want to

420
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,200
address. You have just named a huge

421
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,800
problem in the world. The second is you

422
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,900
have to have a radical proposed solution

423
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,600
to that problem, not radical because you

424
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,133
want to be cool and get cool points in

425
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,934
the world for having been weird, but in

426
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:22,166
the spirit of trying to go to a new

427
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,166
place, to try something that people

428
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,433
haven't tried, to not just be in a

429
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:28,333
smartness contest where everyone else

430
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,200
who's tried to address the problem, but

431
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,800
to be in more of a bravery and

432
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,300
creativity contest with the problem

433
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,700
itself. So that's the second thing, having

434
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,533
a radical foreclosed solution. And then

435
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,266
the third at least as we would define it,

436
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:42,033
but I suppose there other ways of

437
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:44,100
dressing problems, but at X we would say

438
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,166
that the third aspect

439
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,667
that you have to bring in order for it

440
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,834
to be a moonshot, is you have to present

441
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:53,000
some kind of breakthrough technology or

442
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,100
proposed set of technologies which

443
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,066
brought together would be a breakthrough,

444
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:59,033
that would enable this science-fiction

445
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:01,433
sounding product or service that would

446
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,667
solve that problem. Put in that way,

447
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,967
there's no reason that you couldn't

448
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:09,600
solve starvation and hunger using those

449
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,734
tools, and I hope you do. >> Thank you.

450
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:17,533
>> You just described some of the criteria for

451
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,500
what makes a good project， but where do

452
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,600
the projects come from originally and

453
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,133
how do you go through vetting

454
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:25,600
them， and forming like a more long-term

455
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,900
project. >> So I could imagine other ways of

456
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,900
doing it, roughly the way it feels at X,

457
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,100
is there's a huge pile of ideas on the

458
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,100
metaphoric table. Anyone can put them on

459
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,533
the table, and by the way, we have a

460
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:42,066
mechanism where you guys can submit on

461
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:45,133
our website: moonshot ideas to X.

462
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:47,367
We're very happy to take them from any

463
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:50,367
in all places, because we believe that

464
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:53,767
ideas by themselves, raw technologies by

465
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,633
themselves, they worth something but

466
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:58,567
they don't reliably turn into something

467
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:01,400
great. That the work that's really

468
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,467
special happens primarily after the idea.

469
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:07,567
So we have this huge pile of ideas on

470
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,600
the table, there isn't an actual table

471
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,200
right, and then a lot of the fail fast, a

472
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,467
lot of the work is how do you pick

473
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,133
through all these things on the table,

474
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,400
and throw them away as fast as possible,

475
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,900
as efficiently as possible, but for good

476
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,333
reasons, not for fake reasons. f you're

477
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,433
like I don't like that one, it's easy to

478
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:28,834
take it off the table, but you haven't

479
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:30,266
actually added any value, that's not a

480
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:32,867
good reason. If you pick one off the

481
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,700
table and you say, hey look, this one

482
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,100
breaks the second law of thermodynamics.

483
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,133
I think we can throw that one away

484
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,467
without further discussion. Oh look, this

485
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:43,233
one is made of unobtainium, right, so we

486
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:46,600
can throw that one away. Sadly not all of

487
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,233
them can be removed from the table as

488
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,900
easily as those, and so you often have to

489
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,400
do real work. Sometimes you have to build

490
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,233
prototypes, you have to talk to the

491
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,667
people who act in that ecosystem and say,

492
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:59,433
if we built this thing would it solve

493
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:01,834
the problem? And then they say, not really,

494
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:03,667
well that's good to know, thank goodness,

495
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,266
we didn't spend a huge amount of time

496
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:07,266
and money building the thing, only to

497
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,934
discover at the end, that that wasn't

498
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,333
really going to solve the problem in the

499
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,800
world. So that is one of the main muscles

500
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,967
at X, is how do you get people both to

501
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:18,633
feel good about throwing stuff onto the

502
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:21,300
table, and feel good about taking it back

503
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,467
off the table, and the best-case scenario,

504
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:25,100
which has happened a few times that X, is

505
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,433
when the both happen in the same meeting,

506
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:31,367
when someone gets a brownie point from

507
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,633
me or from others, for having brought up

508
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:36,934
a beautiful idea, and in the same meeting

509
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:40,233
throw the idea way, and gets two pieces

510
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,900
of brownie point, that's failing fast.

511
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,533
When they feel like they got brownie

512
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:44,734
points for putting on the table and

513
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:46,767
taking it off in a half an hour meeting.

514
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:53,300
>> So I was about to pass this question, but

515
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,133
then when you said that don't regret it

516
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:59,700
tomorrow, that's why I came in here. >> Good.

517
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:05,100
>> So both of you are people who have

518
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,967
created the kind of impact which

519
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:09,533
everyone here wants to create in their

520
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:15,166
lives. But my question is that, suppose

521
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,367
you have a person like me, I have figured

522
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:19,000
out that this is my passion, this is the

523
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,700
problem I want to solve, but along the

524
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,100
side, I need to stay relevant, I need to

525
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,001
know the current affairs, I need to know

526
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:30,633
like read TechCrunch, wired, Business

527
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,767
Insider, there are like so many resources

528
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:36,100
and all of them creating so much new

529
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,133
information every day, that if I spend

530
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:43,000
time reading those, I won't solve my

531
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,200
problem. I won't be doing my job. So my

532
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,166
question to you is, along with following

533
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:52,133
your passion, how do you spend your time

534
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:57,333
and keep yourself updated. >> So, both of

535
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,967
these answers will be probably

536
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:02,000
popular with you guys, but not popular

537
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,467
with much of the rest of the world. But I

538
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,001
feel pretty strongly about both of them.

539
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:11,367
The first one is, I got lucky. I won't

540
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:14,834
speak for Sebastian, but I got lucky. And

541
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:17,734
I hope that you guys are calibrated on

542
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:22,633
that, that the people who are the most

543
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:25,233
successful, usually worked fairly hard,

544
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:28,100
and they have some skill, that wasn't

545
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,467
entirely luck, but do not believe that

546
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:34,633
there is not a huge amount of luck

547
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:36,633
involved or hold yourself to a standard,

548
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:38,633
as though there were not a huge amount

549
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:40,500
of luck involved. It will drive you crazy

550
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,133
totally unfairly. The second thing is, I

551
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,600
don't read business books, actually

552
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
mostly, I read The Economist every

553
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,700
week, but I mostly don't even read the

554
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,300
news, especially now, it's driving me

555
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:03,533
crazy. You know what I spend time doing> I

556
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:06,834
talk to people and I really listen to

557
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:09,133
them. The things that I was describing

558
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:12,166
about how X is set up, that's not taken

559
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,867
from some great business book I read, I'm

560
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:17,433
actually managing people, and I'm really

561
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:20,266
paying attention to what moves their

562
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:23,467
needle. It's like this observation is

563
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:26,567
just watching people and saying like, oh

564
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,467
I told you to do that and you're doing

565
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,834
this. Why are you doing that? You just go

566
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:34,200
ask them. I have behaviors that you won't

567
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,800
read about in a business book, but I

568
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,767
didn't get them from a business book or

569
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,500
any collection of them. For example,

570
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,066
here's one of my mantras. If you come

571
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:44,066
into my office, and you tell me I'm an

572
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:47,166
idiot, I will say the first words out of

573
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:49,266
my mouth, will absolutely be thank you,

574
00:24:49,266 --> 00:24:51,100
and very likely I will come around the

575
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,333
table and give you a hug. Because if you

576
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,266
don't do that, that will be the last time

577
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:57,433
that person ever says anything hard to

578
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:59,300
you, and probably the last time anyone in

579
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,600
the organization ever says anything hard

580
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,433
and therefore important for you to know,

581
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:06,500
to you. But that's an observation about

582
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,767
humans and like what how they operate. So

583
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:12,300
I strongly believe that there's a ton

584
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,934
that can be learned from working hard,

585
00:25:13,934 --> 00:25:16,200
being open to the fact that you're wrong

586
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,700
a lot of the time, because we're all

587
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,500
wrong a lot of the time, and really

588
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,567
listening to the people around you. They

589
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,467
have a lot to teach you. So that doesn't

590
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:27,633
mean never read any books, but I think

591
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:29,133
that the idea that you can somehow

592
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:32,133
program yourself by cleverly picking the

593
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:34,700
one percent of the fire hose of data

594
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,734
that's coming at you, and only listen to

595
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:38,967
that one percent, is a bit of a fantasy.

596
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:44,667
>> Thank you. >> Yeah. >> My question is a little

597
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,400
bit in line with that, so that's a

598
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,834
fireside chats or personal questions,

599
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:54,001
Okay? I think. So obviously you are [inaudiable]

600
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:56,934
inspiration and very successful what

601
00:25:56,934 --> 00:25:59,133
you are doing, is there anything you had

602
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:01,433
to stop doing or anything you had to

603
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:04,100
sacrifice doing during that time?

604
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,166
>> Yeah I mean I've certainly had to

605
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:11,900
sacrifice a lot of things, but a few of

606
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,266
them that have been particularly hard

607
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:16,200
for me, for example, I'm a people pleaser.

608
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,200
I like to resolve conflict, and I'm

609
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,467
physically feel you know, sick might be

610
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:26,667
an exaggeration, but uncomfortable when

611
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:29,300
people around me fight. Even if they work

612
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,900
for me, I feel bad about it. Obviously,

613
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,533
that's totally dysfunctional for me to

614
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,834
be running an organization when I can't

615
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:39,667
be direct and have conflict with people,

616
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,133
it's really important that I'd be able

617
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,934
to do that. So that's an example of

618
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,533
something that I have learned how to do

619
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:48,734
when I have mantras and structures for

620
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:51,066
emotional structures, that to get me to

621
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:55,367
do it, and to do it quickly, in fact. But

622
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:56,900
it still doesn't feel very good when I

623
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,967
do it, and that's the sort of thing I

624
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:01,200
kind of wish I didn't come out

625
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,100
card-carrying nerd, and yet, I don't

626
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,533
actually spend very much in my time on

627
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:08,500
those things, that's another sacrifice. I

628
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,967
want to end up actually tinkering and

629
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,633
like thinking some the new stuff. I'm an

630
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,567
entrepreneur I went to like actually run

631
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,333
one of the projects at X, there's a

632
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,600
real sense in which I actually don't

633
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,967
want the job that I have. The reason that

634
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:24,900
I'm doing it, is because I believe that

635
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,333
I'm nurturing this group of people and

636
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,200
making something possible that wouldn't

637
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,934
be possible otherwise, and that gives me

638
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:33,033
a real sense of purpose. Even though on a

639
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:34,734
day-to-day basis, it's kind of not what

640
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:36,333
would be most fun for me. So that's

641
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:41,066
another example. >> Thank you. >> Hi Sebastian. Hi

642
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:44,300
Astro. I'm curious is if you think that

643
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,333
there is a opportunity to create a

644
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:50,133
start-up around. Like a dating

645
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:52,500
application that uses machine learning

646
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,633
and AI, because we all know divorce is like

647
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:58,767
a giant problem in our country. But maybe

648
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:00,567
that uses like Google glass or something

649
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:03,200
to create perfect matches. Or do you think...

650
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,767
>> I am totally letting Sebastian

651
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:11,600
take this one. >> Great question! >> Haha.

652
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,066
>> Sorry what was the question? >> Build it.

653
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:18,667
Do you think a start, there could be

654
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,467
like a start-up, kind of like Tinder

655
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,433
that uses machine learning and AI to

656
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,867
create like perfect great relationship

657
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:27,734
so you can avoid divorce in the future.

658
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:36,467
>> So let me just answer

659
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:42,800
this differently. The number of emails I

660
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,533
get, for every stupid reason, mostly from

661
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,001
German, stands out because there was in

662
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:48,734
German television, some futuristic show

663
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:51,934
of people who build contraptions that

664
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:54,734
solve climate change and make clocks go

665
00:28:54,734 --> 00:29:00,667
backwards is huge. And sometimes drive we

666
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,867
nuts to see their people like spend so

667
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,333
much time inventing things. I look at

668
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:09,166
them and say, why? Maybe, I mean fixing

669
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:13,233
divorces might be a good thing. But what I often

670
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,767
find, is that people are taken by a

671
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:19,033
technical idea. They find whatever

672
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:21,400
the sake combined. I'm going to pull your

673
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,166
long to say, you say Tinder with machine

674
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:27,400
learning. It's a technical idea, but for

675
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,433
me, the first step is always to think

676
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:33,066
about the problem. So to give an example,

677
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:35,467
I have a lot of robotics colleagues, some

678
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:37,233
very prominent one on the room here, and

679
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:42,900
any robotics professor takes the dogma

680
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,700
that all problems in the world are

681
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,200
solved by robots. Right? So you'd go for

682
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,567
example, and would say, I build humanoid

683
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:54,166
robots, and what can they do, well, how

684
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,633
about elderly care. All of Japanese

685
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:58,367
robotics I have [inaudible] does, is like

686
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:00,066
that they have done it for 20 years, put

687
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:02,200
a human robots, because since the building

688
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,266
human items must be useful, right? And it

689
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:06,600
must use for something, so use for

690
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,800
everything. Let me find the most useful

691
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,600
thing is a daily care. And a company

692
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,767
come to me and say, what do you think about if I

693
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,066
can start a company on robots for

694
00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:15,800
elderly care, they have two legs. And

695
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,066
they're obviously, that sounds great,

696
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,867
let's do one little excursion, okay?

697
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:23,166
Suppose you want to solve the elderly

698
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:24,834
care product project problem, the ones

699
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:25,533
you want to solve,

700
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,100
whatever that one is. Let's think what's

701
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,900
the best solution for that problem, if it

702
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,734
still involves the robots inside your

703
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:36,433
company. All right? So, suppose you're

704
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:37,900
going to solve the divorce problem in

705
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,367
this country, you really want to solve it,

706
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:41,133
went fewer divorces, say for whatever

707
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:44,367
reason, then let's take out what is the

708
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:46,233
best solution with this problem, and if

709
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:47,734
you come up and think it's machine

710
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:52,967
learning on Tinder, then, bulid it.

711
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,800
>> I think that's a fine answer. I would also

712
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,367
say that, you know, machine learning and

713
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:02,166
Tinder might not make our list at X, but

714
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:06,433
the general answer at X would be, how

715
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:08,834
fast, how long does it take for you to

716
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,166
think about it, and talk to people? And

717
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:13,233
how long does it take for you to make a

718
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:15,667
prototype of it. Because if you can make

719
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,433
a prototype of it really fast, the right

720
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:19,400
answer might be, don't worry about it,

721
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,233
just like make it and try it. You'd be

722
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:24,800
amazed what making it and trying it, like

723
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,533
maybe it's going to go supernova and you

724
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,066
don't have to have these arguments, with

725
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:29,700
idiots who don't understand it like us,

726
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,934
or maybe it turns out that it's

727
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,800
actually not a good idea, and then

728
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,333
that'll be the fastest way to discover

729
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:37,834
that it's not a good idea. So that's not

730
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:40,333
always the right thing to do, but that

731
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,266
one sounds like you could prototype

732
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:44,567
something so fast that it might actually

733
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,600
be faster to just make it, instead of

734
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,633
trying to figure out whether you're

735
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:51,633
right or not. >> Unfortunately,

736
00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:53,567
unfortunately we run out of time. A few

737
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:56,834
seconds left. Astra it has been... >> Great.

738
00:31:56,834 --> 00:32:00,133
Thank you. I want to end by saying that,

739
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:04,433
>> Don't listen. >> That just so funny that's

740
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:07,500
exactly what I was going to say, so when

741
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,834
I started at X a long time ago, I

742
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:16,367
reported to Sebastian, and he gave me, so

743
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,867
he was my manager, and I really admire

744
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:22,467
you, Sebastian. And I just want to leave

745
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,600
these guys with something that I think

746
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,767
about, and I know you said it

747
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,233
tongue-in-cheek, and I'm going to say it,

748
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:30,300
partly to tease you, but I also mean it

749
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,934
sincerely to them, and I know you meant

750
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:34,734
it sincerely to me. The first and

751
00:32:34,734 --> 00:32:36,734
only really sincere feedback that

752
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:38,800
Sebastian ever gave me,

753
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,200
as my manager was, don't listen to your

754
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:49,000
manager. >> And you were good at it.

755
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,967
You were good at it. >> And,

756
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:59,633
ironically, that was such important

757
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:03,667
feedback for me, that it's really stuck

758
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,400
with me, and it's part of why I admire

759
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,800
you. Thank you for being a guide for me,

760
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,533
and for all of us. >> My manager sits over

761
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:12,633
there, and I can see how he's cringing

762
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:16,667
request. >> Haha. >> Exactly what to do.

763
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:25,667
>> Thank you, Sebastian!

764
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,734
>> Thank you.
